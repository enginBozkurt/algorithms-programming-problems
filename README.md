# algorithms-programming-problems
Notes and code from HackerRank Challenges and other programming problems.

**NOTE: I am working to expand the Algorithms directory. I do not have plans to expand on the other directories in the short term.**

## Contents

1. Algorithm implementations: `algorithms`
2. Programming Problems: `programming-problems`
3. Flashcards: `flashcards`

## 1. Algorithm implementations

Implementations of key algorithms for tackling programming problems. Language: Python 3.

## 2. Programming Problems

### Problems by Problem Areas
Problems classified by area are from HackerRank. 

**Finding these problems**: E.g. problems in the category 'Mathematics' are in a directory called 'mathematics'.
* Algorithms
* Functional Programming (Haskell)
* Mathematics
  * Primarily Project Euler problems
* RegEx (Regular Expressions)
* SQL
* Statistics 
  * HackerRank's Intro to Statistics Series

### Problem Sources (non-HackerRank)
These problems are not classified by area, but by source. These problems are not from HackerRank.
* InterviewCake
* Cracking the Coding Interview by Gabrielle Laakmann-McDowell (`laakmann-mcdowell`)

## 3. Flashcards
Flashcard content to import into Anki (flashcard software).

* General programming terminology
* Python syntax

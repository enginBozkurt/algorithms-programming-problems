# Algorithms

Algorithms implemented in Python. Implementations of machine learning algorithms can be found in the directory `machine-learning`.

Algorithms implemented:
- Breadth-first search `bfs.py`
- Depth-first search `dfs.py`
- Flood fill (DFS version) `flood_fill.py`
- Finding articulation points (brute force only)
    - TODO: reframe as using backedge technique to (1) find articulation points, (2) find bridges
- Dynamic programming (as ipynb)

Data structures and environments implemented:
- Graphs
- 2D grid

TODO:
- BFS and DFS as part of the Graph class
- Greedy
- Dynamic programming as a .py file
- Shortest path
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Sorts
- Searches
    - Complete Search
    - Heuristic search
    - Approximate search
- Knapsack
- Computational geometry
- Network flow
- Eulerian Path
- Two-dimensional convex hull
- BigNums
- Finding articulation points (uses backedges or bridges)
- Other graph algorithms (Hamiltonian Path, Maximum Flow, min cost max flow, topological sort)

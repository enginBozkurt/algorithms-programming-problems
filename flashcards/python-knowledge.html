What does 'first class object' mean?;

egs of first-class objects in Python; Functions, classes.

Is Python interpreted or compiled?; interpreted.

typing of Python; dynamically typed (vs statically typed, specify types)

does Python have access specifiers?; No. (e.g. C++'s public, private. bc 'we are all adults here'.)

compiled vs interpreted languages; - compiled: (compiled code) can be executed directly in the CPU's 'native' language. - interpreted: must be translated at runtime from original format to CPU machine instructions

Deep vs shallow copy; -Shallow copy copies reference pointers and changes to copied will change original. Faster. - Deep copy copies values but not reference pointers, is slower.

Deep copy; Stores values copied separately. - Doesn't copy reference pointers. - Changes made in copy won't affect original etc. - Slower than shallow copy.

Shallow copy; Copies reference pointers just like it copies values. - Changes made will also affect the original. - faster execution that depends on data size(?)

lists vs tuples; lists are mutable, tuples are not.

How multithreading is done in Python; - Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): makes sure only one thread executes at a time. Thread acquires GIL, does some work, then passes GIL onto next thread. - i.e. take turns using same CPU core. - GIL passing adds overhead to execution (slower)

example of ternary operator; 5 if x > 4 else 4
